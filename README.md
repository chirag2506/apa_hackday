This is an android app to be used by commuters travelling near accident prone areas. They will be notified once they reach about 500 m near a black spot. Policemen can login using their PIS number (which is unique for every policman) and can enter the location of a place where accident took place using GPS. The severity of accidents on a particular black spot is done using a Machine learning classification algorithm and represented using green, orange and red colour.
Due to lack of time and our inability we couldnt complete our project. The backend is ready and hosted on https://apaserver.herokuapp.com/
